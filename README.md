# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

# Overview of the Analysis:

This project is to assist the data analytics teams from AutosRUs on the MechaCar project. By using RStudio, we will perform the multivariable linear regression on the mpg dataset, and a series of tests, to determine the following analytical questions:
1. Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
2. Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
3. Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
4. Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.
